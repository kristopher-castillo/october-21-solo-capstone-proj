Smashed garlic cloves roast with the squash to gently flavor it, then become silky-soft treasures youâ€™ll discover while eating. Finishing the dish with lime cuts through the richness of the butter, but you can use lemon, too. Try using other vegetables like eggplant, pumpkin or carrots to make this dish your own.",
